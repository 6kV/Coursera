# Coursera-Scala

SBT : similar to Maven or Ant  
command sbt about to check the version  
build.sbt correspond au pom.xml  

## Week 1
3 paradigms principaux en informatique :
 + Fonctionnelle
 + imperative
 + logique
 
le OO est orthogonal aux 3 paradigmes.

### imperative
+ modifiying mutables variables
+ using assignements
+ control structures such as if-then-else, loops, break

-> instruction sequences as a Von Neumann computer
computer = processeur, memory, bus qui lie les deux (32,64 bits)

theory : one or more datatype
 operations on these types
 law that describe the relationships between values and operations
 
 -> doesn't describe mutation

 ### Functional
 
 + programming without mutables variables, assignements, loops and other imperative control structures
 + focusing in functions
 + functions can be values that are produced, consumed and composed
 + all this becomes easier in a functional language
