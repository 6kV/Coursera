### Observer Pattern

Good part
 + decouples views from State
 + Allows to have a varying number of views of a given state
 + Simple to set Up
 
Bad PArts:
 + Forces imperatives styles, since handlers are Unit-Typed
 + Many moving parts that need to be co-ordicated
 + Concurrency makes things more complicated
 + Views are stull tightly bound to one state, view update happens immediatly
